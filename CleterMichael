There is a little boy who gets into trouble often. He just had a temper tantrum and now his dad has decided to punish him.
His dad told him that for punishment, he must build a fence.
The boy has a decison to make now. He must build the fence or run away.

==build the fence==
The little boy from scratch has taken strips of wood and nails to build a brand new fence.
He feels angry having to build the fence. The more nails he hammers in, the more power of anger he puts into them.
He finally gets to the end. He calls for his dad to say he is done.

===run away===
The little boy has run away from home. He has no idea where he is going. 
As more time passes by, the little boy feels lonely and scared. He wonders if running away is worse than punishment.
He wants to go back home. And so he does.

The little boy says he understands why he was being punished. His dad tells him it's time to finish the punishment.
The boy has another decision to make. He must take the nails out of the fence or tell his dad he will not do it.

====take the nails out====
The little boy is confused why he must take the nails out. A fence was just built, now it must be taken down.
The little boy says he will do it anyway. It takes time and hardwork but he finishes. He tells his dad that he is done.
His dad tells him to look at the holes in the fence. 
His dad explains that sometimes you can damage things and try to fix it, but those wounds will not heal.

=====tell dad no=====
The little boy explains a fence was just built. He doesn't know why his dad wants it to be taken down. 
His dad says its for a purpose. The little boy still doesn't do it. 
His dad explains the purpose was to show that you can try to fix things you damaged earlier, but those wounds will not heal.

The little boy understands. He understood that when he had his temper tantrums, sometimes he was unable to fix those things.
That is how it worked with the fence. He damaged the fence by hammering nails into it. Tried to fix it by taking them out.
The fence has holes in it. It's not healed.

The little boy doesn't understand. A fence was just built and then it was taken down. 
He looks at it and thinks hardwork was put into it for nothing. He is mad and throws another tantrum.
